# Intended Uses and Goals

The primary goal of Rakis is to enable **decentralized inference** for artificial intelligence models, allowing for their integration with smart contracts and blockchain-based applications. This opens up a wide range of potential use cases and opportunities for leveraging AI in a trustless, permissionless manner.

## Integrating AI with Smart Contracts

One of the core intended uses of Rakis is to facilitate the integration of AI models with smart contracts. By providing a decentralized inference network, Rakis allows smart contracts to leverage the capabilities of AI without relying on centralized services or trusted third parties.

<Callout>
Imagine a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that can automatically evaluate grant proposals or investment opportunities using state-of-the-art language models. Or a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that can analyze market trends and news articles to identify potential trading strategies or risk factors.
</Callout>

This integration opens up a wide range of possibilities, enabling smart contracts to perform tasks that were previously impractical or impossible due to the limitations of traditional computational models.

## Democratizing Access to AI

Another key goal of Rakis is to **democratize access to AI** by leveraging the decentralized nature of the network. Traditional AI services are often provided by centralized entities, which can lead to issues such as high costs, censorship, and lack of transparency.

<Callout>
Rakis aims to create a level playing field where anyone can contribute to the network by running nodes and participating in the inference process. This fosters an ecosystem of collaboration and shared resources, ensuring that access to AI capabilities is not limited by financial or geographical constraints.

By running entirely in the browser, Rakis makes it possible for individuals and organizations with limited computational resources to leverage the power of AI without the need for expensive hardware or infrastructure.

## Fostering Innovation and Collaboration

The decentralized and open-source nature of Rakis is designed to foster innovation and collaboration within the AI and blockchain communities. By providing a platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to contribute and experiment, Rakis aims to accelerate the development of new AI applications and use cases.

<Callout>
Imagine a vibrant ecosystem where individuals and organizations can collaborate on developing and deploying AI models, sharing resources and insights, and collectively driving the evolution of decentralized AI solutions.
</Callout>

Furthermore, the transparency and auditability of the network can help build trust and encourage the responsible development and deployment of AI systems, promoting ethical and socially responsible practices.

## Expanding the Capabilities of Smart Contracts

Ultimately, Rakis seeks to expand the capabilities of smart contracts by introducing a new instruction set: the ability to leverage AI models and natural language processing. This opens up a world of possibilities for creating more sophisticated and intelligent smart contracts.

<Callout>
Envision self-executing trusts and grants that can understand and respond to natural language prompts, or decentralized applications that can interact with users in a more natural and intuitive way, thanks to the integration of language models.
</Callout>

By bridging the gap between AI and blockchain technology, Rakis has the potential to unlock new levels of automation, intelligence, and user-friendliness for decentralized applications and smart contracts.
