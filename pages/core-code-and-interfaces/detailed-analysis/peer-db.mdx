# Peer DB

The Peer DB is responsible for storing and managing information about peers in the Rakis network. It acts as a central repository for peer data, allowing other components of the system to access and update peer-related information as needed.

## Peer Information Storage

The primary function of the Peer DB is to store and retrieve information about peers. This information includes:

- **Synthient ID**: The public key that identifies a peer in the Rakis network.
- **Last Seen**: The timestamp of when the peer was last seen active in the network.
- **Seen On**: The list of P2P delivery networks (e.g., Nostr, Torrent, NKN) through which the peer has been observed.
- **Chain Identities**: The identities (addresses and signatures) of the peer on various blockchain networks they are connected to.
- **Device Info**: Optional information about the peer's device, which can be used to measure the network's heterogeneity.

This information is stored in a Dexie.js database, which provides a simple and efficient way to manage IndexedDB data within the browser.

## Peer Identity Management

The Peer DB plays a crucial role in managing and verifying the identities of peers in the network. When a peer connects to the network or updates their chain identities, the Peer DB is responsible for verifying the authenticity of the provided information.

<Steps>

### Step 1

The Peer DB receives a packet containing the peer's chain identities, which include the blockchain address, chain, and a signature of the peer's Synthient ID using the blockchain address.

### Step 2

The Peer DB calls the `updateChainIdentities` function, which iterates through the provided chain identities and verifies each one using the `verifyEthChainSignature` function.

```js
const updatedPeer: Peer = existingPeer || {
  synthientId: peer.synthientId,
  seenOn: peer.seenOn,
  lastSeen: new Date(peer.lastSeen),
  chainIds: [],
};

updatedPeer.chainIds = await this.updateChainIdentities(
  updatedPeer.chainIds,
  peer.synthientId,
  peer.chainIds
);
```

### Step 3

If the verification succeeds, the Peer DB adds the chain identity to the peer's list of chain identities. If the verification fails, the chain identity is discarded.

</Steps>

By verifying the chain identities, the Peer DB ensures that only valid and authenticated identities are associated with each peer, preventing potential spoofing or impersonation attacks.

## Peer List Management

In addition to storing peer information, the Peer DB is responsible for managing and distributing a list of known peers in the network. This list is essential for maintaining the decentralized nature of Rakis and ensuring that peers can discover and connect with each other.

<Callout>
The Peer DB implements a probabilistic communication strategy to distribute the peer list. A configurable number of peers (e.g., 40) are randomly selected to broadcast their known peer lists when a new peer joins the network or when a significant number of new peers are discovered.
</Callout>

This distribution mechanism helps to ensure that the peer list remains up-to-date and that new peers can quickly discover and connect with existing peers in the network.

```js
const commsProbability = packetDBSettings.peerCommunicationCount / peerList.length;

if (Math.random() < commsProbability) {
  const knownPeers: KnownPeers = {
    type: "knownPeers",
    peerList: peerList.map((peer) => ({
      synthientId: peer.synthientId,
      identities: peer.chainIds,
      lastSeen: peer.lastSeen && stringifyDateWithOffset(peer.lastSeen),
      seenOn: peer.seenOn,
    })),
    createdAt: stringifyDateWithOffset(new Date()),
  };

  await this.transmitPacket(knownPeers);
}
```

By managing and distributing the peer list, the Peer DB facilitates the discovery and connectivity of peers within the Rakis network, ensuring that the network remains decentralized and resilient.

## Querying and Filtering Peers

The Peer DB provides various methods for querying and filtering peers based on different criteria. For example, you can retrieve the last N peers seen after a specific time, get the total number of peers, or retrieve all peers in the database.

```js
// Get the last N peers seen after a specific time
await this.db.peers
  .where("lastSeen")
  .aboveOrEqual(lastSeenAfter)
  .limit(maxCount)
  .toArray();

// Get the total number of peers (optionally after a specific time)
await this.db.peers.where("lastSeen").aboveOrEqual(lastSeenAfter).count();

// Get all peers in the database
await this.db.peers.toArray();
```

These querying capabilities allow other components of Rakis to retrieve and filter peer information as needed, enabling efficient management and utilization of peer data throughout the system.

Overall, the Peer DB plays a vital role in maintaining the decentralized nature of the Rakis network by managing and verifying peer identities, distributing peer lists, and providing efficient querying and filtering capabilities for peer data.
