# Conclusion

In this documentation, we have explored the Rakis project, a novel decentralized inference network that runs entirely in the browser. Rakis presents a unique approach to integrating artificial intelligence capabilities with blockchain technology, enabling a wide range of potential applications.

The key highlights of the Rakis project include:

- **Browser-based AI Inference**: Rakis is designed to run completely in the browser, without relying on external servers or centralized infrastructure. This decentralized architecture democratizes access to AI capabilities and ensures transparency and control for users.

- **Consensus Mechanism**: The embedding-based consensus mechanism employed by Rakis allows for the computation of deterministic results from non-deterministic language models. This innovative approach addresses a fundamental challenge in decentralized AI systems.

- **Blockchain Integration**: By connecting to various blockchain networks, Rakis enables the integration of AI capabilities directly into smart contracts. This opens up new possibilities for self-executing code, autonomous agents, and decentralized applications.

- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Rakis operates on a peer-to-peer network, leveraging multiple redundant delivery channels for message propagation and ensuring resilience and fault tolerance.

The potential applications of Rakis are vast and far-reaching. From decentralized prediction markets and autonomous financial agents to self-executing trusts and grants, the ability to incorporate AI capabilities into smart contracts unlocks a new realm of possibilities. Additionally, Rakis could contribute to sybil detection, content moderation, and even self-improving AI systems.
