# Getting Started

Setting up and running Rakis is straightforward. Follow the steps below to get started.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (or npm, if you prefer)

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the Rakis repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rakis.git
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd rakis
yarn install
```

### Step 4: Configure Settings

Rakis comes with a set of default settings, but you can customize them according to your needs. The settings are located in `src/rakis-core/synthient-chain/thedomain/settings.ts`.

<Callout>
**Note:** It's recommended to review the settings and make any necessary adjustments before running Rakis.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Build the Project

Build the project by running the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Step 6: Run Rakis

After the build process is complete, you can start Rakis:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch Rakis in your default browser. You should see a user interface where you can interact with the decentralized inference network.

</Steps>

**Important:** Rakis is designed to run in a browser environment. While it can be run locally, it's recommended to deploy it on a server or hosting platform for optimal performance and accessibility.

## Configuring Rakis

Rakis provides several configuration options to customize its behavior. Here's an overview of the most commonly used settings:

- **Peer-to-Peer Networks**: Rakis supports multiple P2P networks, such as GunDB, NKN, and Trystero (for Nostr and Torrent). You can enable or disable specific networks in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS = {
  enabledP2PNetworks: ["nostr", "gun", "torrent", "nkn"],
  // ...
}
```

- **Chain Connections**: Rakis can connect to various blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. Configure the supported chains and connection details in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_CHAIN_CONNECTION_SETTINGS = {
  dAppName: "Rakis",
  url: "https://rakis.ai",
}
```

- **Quorum Settings**: Adjust the quorum settings, such as the timeout for quorum reveals and the consensus window, in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS = {
  quorumRevealTimeoutMs: 20000,
  quorumRevealRequestIssueTimeoutMs: 10000,
  quorumConsensusWindowMs: 30000,
  // ...
}
```

- **LLM Engine Settings**: Configure the settings for the Large Language Model (LLM) engine, such as the engine log limit and loading progress debounce, in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_LLM_ENGINE_SETTINGS = {
  engineLogLimit: 2000,
  debounceLoadingProgressEventMs: 50,
}
```

For more advanced configuration options, refer to the [Core Code and Interfaces](/core-code-and-interfaces) section.

## Running with Custom Settings

To run Rakis with custom settings, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `src/rakis-core/synthient-chain/thedomain` directory, e.g., `custom-settings.ts`.
2. Import the default settings and modify them as needed:

```typescript
import { DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS, DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS, LOADED_SETTINGS } from './settings';

const customSettings: LOADED_SETTINGS = {
  ...DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS,
  ...DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS,
  // Modify settings as needed
  p2pSettings: {
    ...DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS,
    enabledP2PNetworks: ['nostr', 'gun'], // Enable only Nostr and GunDB
  },
  quorumSettings: {
    ...DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS,
    quorumRevealTimeoutMs: 30000, // Increase the reveal timeout to 30 seconds
  },
};

export default customSettings;
```

3. In the entry point of your application (e.g., `src/index.ts`), import your custom settings and pass them to the `TheDomain.bootup` method:

```typescript
import customSettings from './rakis-core/synthient-chain/thedomain/custom-settings';

TheDomain.bootup({
  identityPassword: 'your-password',
  overwriteIdentity: false,
  initialEmbeddingWorkers: customSettings.workerSettings.initialEmbeddingWorkers,
  initialLLMWorkers: customSettings.workerSettings.initialLLMWorkers,
  settings: customSettings,
});
```

By following these steps, you can run Rakis with your custom settings without modifying the core codebase.

## Examples and Use Cases

To better understand how to use Rakis, let's explore a few examples and use cases.

### Decentralized Inference

One of the primary use cases of Rakis is decentralized inference. Here's an example of how you can request an inference from the network:

```javascript
const domain = await TheDomain.bootup({
  identityPassword: 'your-password',
  // ...
});

const prompt = "Write a short story about a robot that dreams of becoming a poet.";

const inferenceRequest: InferenceRequest = {
  requestId: generateUniqueId(),
  payload: {
    fromChain: "ethereum",
    blockNumber: 12345678,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    prompt,
    acceptedModels: ["gemma-2b-it-q4f16_1"],
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 500,
    securityFrame: {
      quorum: 5,
      maxTimeMs: 60000,
      secDistance: 0.5,
      secPercentage: 0.8,
      embeddingModel: "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5",
    },
  },
  fetchedAt: new Date(),
};

domain.inferenceDB.saveInferenceRequest(inferenceRequest);
```

In this example, we create an `InferenceRequest` object with the prompt, accepted models, security frame, and other parameters. We then save the request to the `inferenceDB`, which triggers the inference process on the decentralized network.

You can monitor the progress of the inference and retrieve the results using the methods provided by the `inferenceDB` and `quorumDB`.

### Smart Contract Integration

Rakis can integrate with smart contracts on various blockchain networks. Here's an example of how you can add a chain identity to your Rakis node:

```javascript
const domain = await TheDomain.bootup({
  identityPassword: 'your-password',
  // ...
});

const signature = "0x..."; // Signature of your synthientId obtained from your wallet
const chain = "ethereum";
const signedWithWallet = "metamask";

const success = await domain.addChainIdentity(signature, chain, signedWithWallet);

if (success) {
  console.log("Chain identity added successfully!");
} else {
  console.error("Failed to add chain identity.");
}
```

In this example, we obtain a signature of our `synthientId` from our Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask). We then call the `addChainIdentity` method on the `TheDomain` instance, passing the signature, chain name, and the wallet used for signing.

Once the chain identity is added, Rakis can interact with smart contracts on that chain, enabling various use cases such as decentralized inference as a service, self-executing grants and trusts, and more.
