# Getting Started

Setting up and running Rakis is straightforward. Follow the steps below to get started.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the Rakis repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rakis.git
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd rakis
bun install
```

### Step 4: Configure Settings

Rakis comes with a set of default settings, but you can customize them according to your needs. The settings are located in `src/rakis-core/synthient-chain/thedomain/settings.ts`.

### Step 5: Run Rakis

After the build process is complete, you can start Rakis:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will launch Rakis in your default browser. You should see a user interface where you can interact with the decentralized inference network.

  You can also run `bun run build` to compile Rakis into a static site to be
  deployed anywhere.

## Configuring Rakis

Rakis provides several configuration options to customize its behavior. Here's an overview of the most commonly used settings:

- **Peer-to-Peer Networks**: Rakis supports multiple P2P networks, such as GunDB, NKN, and Trystero (for Nostr and Torrent). You can enable or disable specific networks in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS = {
  enabledP2PNetworks: ["nostr", "gun", "torrent", "nkn"],
  // ...
};
```

- **Chain Connections**: Rakis can connect to various blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Avalanche. Configure the supported chains and connection details in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_CHAIN_CONNECTION_SETTINGS = {
  dAppName: "Rakis",
  url: "https://rakis.ai",
};
```

- **Quorum Settings**: Adjust the quorum settings, such as the timeout for quorum reveals and the consensus window, in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS = {
  quorumRevealTimeoutMs: 20000,
  quorumRevealRequestIssueTimeoutMs: 10000,
  quorumConsensusWindowMs: 30000,
  // ...
};
```

- **LLM Engine Settings**: Configure the settings for the Large Language Model (LLM) engine, such as the engine log limit and loading progress debounce, in `settings.ts`:

```javascript
export const DEFAULT_LLM_ENGINE_SETTINGS = {
  engineLogLimit: 2000,
  debounceLoadingProgressEventMs: 50,
};
```

For more advanced configuration options, refer to the [Core Code and Interfaces](/core-code-and-interfaces) section.

## Running with Custom Settings

To run Rakis with custom settings, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `src/rakis-core/synthient-chain/thedomain` directory, e.g., `custom-settings.ts`.
2. Import the default settings and modify them as needed:

```typescript
import {
  DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS,
  DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS,
  LOADED_SETTINGS,
} from "./settings";

const customSettings: LOADED_SETTINGS = {
  ...DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS,
  ...DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS,
  // Modify settings as needed
  p2pSettings: {
    ...DEFAULT_P2P_SETTINGS,
    enabledP2PNetworks: ["nostr", "gun"], // Enable only Nostr and GunDB
  },
  quorumSettings: {
    ...DEFAULT_QUORUM_SETTINGS,
    quorumRevealTimeoutMs: 30000, // Increase the reveal timeout to 30 seconds
  },
};

export default customSettings;
```

3. In the entry point of your application (e.g., `src/index.ts`), import your custom settings and pass them to the `TheDomain.bootup` method:

```typescript
import customSettings from "./rakis-core/synthient-chain/thedomain/custom-settings";

TheDomain.bootup({
  identityPassword: "your-password",
  overwriteIdentity: false,
  initialEmbeddingWorkers:
    customSettings.workerSettings.initialEmbeddingWorkers,
  initialLLMWorkers: customSettings.workerSettings.initialLLMWorkers,
  settings: customSettings,
});
```

By following these steps, you can run Rakis with your custom settings without modifying the core codebase.

## Examples and Use Cases

To better understand how to use Rakis, let's explore a few examples and use cases.

### Decentralized Inference

One of the primary use cases of Rakis is decentralized inference. Here's an example of how you can request an inference from the network:

```javascript
const domain = await TheDomain.bootup({
  identityPassword: "your-password",
  // ...
});

const prompt =
  "Write a short story about a robot that dreams of becoming a poet.";

const inferenceRequest: InferenceRequest = {
  requestId: generateUniqueId(),
  payload: {
    fromChain: "ethereum",
    blockNumber: 12345678,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    prompt,
    acceptedModels: ["gemma-2b-it-q4f16_1"],
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 500,
    securityFrame: {
      quorum: 5,
      maxTimeMs: 60000,
      secDistance: 0.5,
      secPercentage: 0.8,
      embeddingModel: "nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5",
    },
  },
  fetchedAt: new Date(),
};

domain.inferenceDB.saveInferenceRequest(inferenceRequest);
```

In this example, we create an `InferenceRequest` object with the prompt, accepted models, security frame, and other parameters. We then save the request to the `inferenceDB`, which triggers the inference process on the decentralized network.

You can monitor the progress of the inference and retrieve the results using the methods provided by the `inferenceDB` and `quorumDB`.

For more examples and use cases, refer to the [Core Code and Interfaces](/core-code-and-interfaces) and [Future Work and Roadmap](/future-work-and-roadmap) sections.
