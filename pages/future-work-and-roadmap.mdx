# Future Work and Roadmap

Rakis is an ambitious project, and there is a lot of room for growth and improvement. This section outlines some of the planned features, performance optimizations, and the long-term vision for the project.

## Planned Features

### Sybil Resistance and Incentive Mechanisms

One of the major challenges in any decentralized network is preventing Sybil attacks, where a single entity creates multiple identities to gain an unfair advantage or influence. Currently, Rakis relies on a commitment-and-reveal system, but this is not a complete solution. Future work includes implementing robust Sybil resistance mechanisms and introducing incentive structures to encourage honest participation and discourage malicious behavior.

Potential solutions being explored include:
- Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake systems
- Reputation-based incentives
- Slashing mechanisms for bad actors
</Callout>

### Heterogeneous Inference Models

Currently, Rakis supports a limited set of pre-defined inference models. However, the true power of the network lies in its ability to leverage a diverse range of models from different providers. Future iterations of Rakis will enable participants to contribute their own custom models, further increasing the network's capabilities and resilience against prompt-engineering attacks.

### Improved Consensus Algorithms

The current consensus mechanism in Rakis is a simple clustering-based approach. While functional, it may not be optimal for all use cases. Future work includes exploring more advanced consensus algorithms, such as Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols, to improve the network's security and robustness.

### Privacy and Secure Inference

One of the current limitations of Rakis is the lack of privacy and secure inference capabilities. Future iterations will explore techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy-preserving technologies to enable secure inference without exposing sensitive data.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability

While Rakis currently supports integration with various blockchain networks, true cross-chain interoperability remains a challenge. Future work includes developing standards and protocols to enable seamless communication and value transfer across different blockchain ecosystems, further enhancing the network's utility.

## Performance Optimizations

As Rakis grows and gains more users, performance optimizations will become crucial. Some areas of focus include:

- Improving the scalability and throughput of the P2P network
- Optimizing the inference and consensus algorithms for better resource utilization
- Implementing caching and other techniques to reduce redundant computations
- Exploring sharding and other techniques to distribute the workload across the network

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision for Rakis is to become a decentralized, self-sustaining ecosystem for AI inference and computation. This ecosystem would enable developers, researchers, and organizations to contribute and access AI capabilities in a secure, fair, and transparent manner.

Some key aspects of this vision include:

- A vibrant marketplace for AI models and services
- Decentralized governance and decision-making processes
- Integration with other decentralized technologies (e.g., decentralized storage, oracles)
- Enabling new use cases and applications beyond the initial scope of Rakis

<Callout>
As an open-source project, the success of Rakis relies on the involvement and contributions of the community. We invite developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to join us in shaping the future of decentralized AI inference.
