# Core Code and Interfaces

The core code and interfaces of Rakis are organized into several key components that work together to enable the decentralized inference network. This section will provide an overview of the essential elements and interfaces, covering the inference lifecycle, key objects, and their interactions.

## Inference Lifecycle

The inference lifecycle in Rakis involves several stages, spanning from the initial inference request to the final consensus result. Let's follow the journey of an inference request through the system:

<Steps>
### Step 1

An inference request is initiated, either through a smart contract on a supported blockchain or directly from a peer on the network. The request specifies parameters such as the prompt, accepted models, temperature, max tokens, and a security frame.

### Step 2

The request is processed by the [InferenceDB](/core-code-and-interfaces/databases#inferencedb), which validates the request and schedules it for execution based on the specified security frame and available resources.

### Step 3

The [TheDomain](/core-code-and-interfaces/the-domain) component orchestrates the inference process, assigning available [LLM workers](/core-code-and-interfaces/synthient-chain) to execute the inference based on the accepted models.

### Step 4

Once the inference is completed, the result is passed to the [EmbeddingEngine](/core-code-and-interfaces/synthient-chain) to compute embeddings and binary embeddings (bEmbeddings).

### Step 5

The bEmbeddings are then used in the [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism) to ensure agreement among peers. This involves a commit-reveal process, quorum building, and clustering algorithms to determine the final consensus result.

### Step 6

The consensus result is propagated through the [P2P networks](/core-code-and-interfaces/synthient-chain) to other peers, and the final output is persisted to the relevant databases and, potentially, the initiating blockchain.

</Steps>

## Key Objects and Interfaces

Rakis employs several key objects and interfaces to facilitate the inference process and maintain the integrity of the decentralized network:

### InferenceRequest

The `InferenceRequest` object encapsulates the parameters for an inference task, including the prompt, accepted models, temperature, max tokens, and a security frame (`InferenceSecurityFrame`). It serves as the entry point for inference requests in the system.

```typescript
export type InferenceRequest = Required<UnprocessedInferenceRequest>;

export type UnprocessedInferenceRequest = {
  requestId?: string; // Could just be a hash of known-to-be-unique values
  payload: InferenceRequestPayload;
  endingAt?: Date; // Computed from the securityframe
  fetchedAt: Date;
};
```

### InferenceSecurityFrame

The `InferenceSecurityFrame` defines the security parameters for an inference request, such as the required quorum size, maximum time allowed, embedding distance threshold, and the percentage of peers that must be within the specified distance. This allows for adjustable security bindings based on the application's requirements.

```typescript
export type InferenceSecurityFrame = {
  quorum: number; // Number of inferences that need to happen for a quorum
  maxTimeMs: number; // Max amount of time that this round can take before failed inference
  secDistance: number; // Distance in embeddingspace
  secPercentage: number; // Percentage of quorum that needs to be within secDistance embedding distance
  embeddingModel: EmbeddingModelName;
};
```

### PeerPacket

The `PeerPacket` interface represents the various packets exchanged between peers on the network. These packets facilitate the commit-reveal process, inference requests, consensus results, and other coordination tasks.

```typescript
export type PeerPacket =
  | PeerStatusUpdate
  | PeerHeart
  | PeerInfo
  | PeerConnectedChain
  | InferenceCommit
  | InferenceRevealRequest
  | KnownPeers
  | InferenceReveal
  | P2PInferenceRequestPacket
  | InferenceRevealRejected
  | InferenceQuorumComputed;
```

<Callout>
  The `PeerPacket` interface encompasses various packet types, such as
  `InferenceCommit`, `InferenceRevealRequest`, `InferenceReveal`, and
  `InferenceQuorumComputed`, which are crucial for the commit-reveal process and
  consensus mechanism.
</Callout>

### InferenceQuorum

The `InferenceQuorum` object represents the quorum state for a specific inference request, including the committed and revealed inferences, the quorum threshold, and the current status of the quorum (e.g., awaiting commitments, awaiting reveal, failed, or completed).

```typescript
export type InferenceQuorum = {
  requestId: string;
  status:
    | "awaiting_commitments"
    | "awaiting_reveal"
    | "failed"
    | "completed"
    | "awaiting_consensus" // means getting the embeddings and other processing ready
    | "verifying_consensus";
  quorumThreshold: number;
  endingAt: Date; // Stringified date
  quorumCommitted: number; // Number of peers that have committed a hash
  quorumRevealed: number; // Number of peers that have revealed their embedding
  consensusRequestedAt?: Date; // Time that the consensus was requested
  embeddingModel: EmbeddingModelName;
  quorum: {
    inferenceId: string;
    synthientId: string;
    bEmbeddingHash: string;
    commitReceivedAt: Date;
    reveal?: {
      embedding: number[];
      bEmbedding: number[];
      output: string;
      receivedAt: Date;
    };
  }[];
};
```

These key objects and interfaces, along with their interactions, facilitate the decentralized inference process within the Rakis network.

## Dependencies and Key Projects

Rakis builds upon several key projects and dependencies to enable its functionality:

- [webllm.js](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm): A lightweight library for running LLMs in the browser, used in Rakis for inference tasks.
- [nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text](https://github.com/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text): A text embedding model used for computing embeddings and bEmbeddings in Rakis.
- [trystero](https://github.com/colyseus/trystero): A WebRTC-based peer-to-peer network library used for one of the P2P networks in Rakis.
- [gun](https://github.com/amark/gun): A distributed database and peer-to-peer network used as another P2P network in Rakis.
- [nkn](https://github.com/nknorg/nkn-client-js): A blockchain-based P2P network used in Rakis for decentralized communication.
