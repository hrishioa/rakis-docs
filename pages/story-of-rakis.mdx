# The Story of Rakis

Rakis is a project born out of my fascination with the intersection of artificial intelligence and decentralized systems. The idea of creating a permissionless, decentralized network for running AI inference had been brewing in my mind for quite some time, fueled by the potential applications and benefits it could bring.

The journey of Rakis began with a simple question: **"What if we could run large language models in a decentralized and trustless manner?"** This question quickly evolved into a deeper exploration of the challenges and possibilities of combining AI and blockchain technology.

<Callout type="warning">
  While the idea of decentralized AI inference is not entirely new, most
  existing solutions either rely on trusted parties or centralized
  infrastructure, which inherently undermines the principles of decentralization
  and permissionlessness.

The vision for Rakis was to create a truly decentralized and permissionless network, where inference could be performed without relying on any centralized authority or trusted parties. This meant addressing several key challenges, such as:

- Ensuring the integrity and determinism of AI inference results in a decentralized environment.
- Enabling seamless integration with existing blockchain networks and smart contracts.
- Providing a scalable and efficient infrastructure for running large language models and other AI models.

  The name "Rakis" is an omage to the new name for Arrakis under Leto. Nodes in
  the Rakis network are called Synthients, after the race of embodied AIs in the
  Matrix universe.

The development of Rakis was a journey filled with exploration, experimentation, and overcoming technical challenges. It involved delving deep into the realms of peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms, and browser-based AI inference.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Establish a Robust P2P Network

The first step in building Rakis was to establish a robust peer-to-peer network that could facilitate the exchange of inference requests, results, and other data among nodes. This involved integrating with multiple P2P networks, such as Nostr, GunDB, and NKN, to ensure redundancy and resilience.

### Step 2: Develop a Novel Consensus Mechanism

At the core of Rakis lies a novel consensus mechanism designed specifically for decentralized AI inference. This mechanism leverages embedding-based consensus and a commit-reveal system to ensure the integrity and determinism of inference results, even in the presence of Byzantine actors.

### Step 3: Enable Browser-Based Inference

To truly democratize access to AI inference, Rakis was designed to run entirely in the browser, without relying on centralized servers or infrastructure. This involved integrating with cutting-edge technologies like WebGPU and WebAssembly to enable efficient inference on client devices.

### Step 4: Integrate with Blockchain Networks

To facilitate seamless integration with existing blockchain networks and smart contracts, Rakis incorporates support for connecting AI inference capabilities to various chains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Solana (planned). This opens up a world of possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps) and autonomous agents.

Throughout the development process, I faced numerous challenges, ranging from technical hurdles to conceptual roadblocks. However, the vision of creating a truly decentralized and permissionless AI inference network kept me motivated and inspired.
